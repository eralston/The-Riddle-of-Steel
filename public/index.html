        <h3><a href="#">Beat</a></h3>
        <div> <p>The beat is an attack upon an opponent's weapon or shield in attempt to temporarily remove it from the equation. Beats may only be performed at the start of a bout or following a "pause".  This sudden, brutal, and effective maneuver is executed by declaring "Beat" as your offensive maneuver, along with the dice alloted to the attack.  The defender assigns defense dice to a defensive maneuvert and the context is rolled normally.  If the attacker wins the beat, then the defenders weapon(or whatever is "beaten") is knowed aside and cannot be used in defense on the following exchange.  Additionally, execery success in the attacker's margin costs the defender 2 CP (this functions similar to Shock).  If the defender wins then the round is resolved normally.</p>
        <p>Using a Beat is an excellent way to handle opponents with longer weapons as well: all range penalties are but in half (round down) when beating.</p></div>

        <div> <p>This maneuver uses off-hand weapons (shields, poniards, etc) to bind or pin down an opponent's weapon, opening up a clear follow-up attack.  On one exchange, roll attack as normal with the off-hand weapon or shield (using DTN as ATN for shields).  If this attack is successful, your opponent loses 1 CP for every success in the margin, good on the next exchange.</p></div>

        <div> <p>Attacking with two weapons at once is a tricky thing.  Divide you dice on this attack in any proportion between both weapons (remember weapon length penalties) and attack.  Your opponent may defend by (a) evading (b) blocking or parrying one and hoping the other doesn't hit (c) if properly equipped, block or parry both (d) buy initiative to hit first</p></div>

      <div class="accordion mass-weapons-and-shield longsword">
        <h3><a href="#">Evasive Attack</a></h3>
        <div> <p>This is a defensive measure that takes place during an attack.  In principle the attacker cuts with his weapons while simultaneously jumping backward so as to evade an opponent's attack.  This maneuver requires a great deal of skill, but is indispensable to those who often find themselves in quick-draw style duels where both opponents go straight to attacks.</p>
        <p>
        To excecute this maneuver one attacks as normal, spending an additional die to activate the maneuver.  Once the maneuver is activated, any number of additional dice may be spent to raise your opponent's ATN by one per additional die.  On the downside, your own ATO also raises, though only by one for every two dice spent this way.  It can only be activated as a slash-like manuever.

        <h3><a href="#">Feint-and-Cut</a></h3>
        <div> 
          <p>
            This is the first "trick" that most swordsmen know, consisting of slahing at one region of the body, then changing direction mid-swing in an effort to pass the defender's defenses entirely.  This is relatively difficult and slow, with a high activation cost.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the activation cost is paid, any number of dice may be added to the attacker's hand, at a cost of 1 CP for every additional die rolled in the attack.  A feint in always declared <em>after</em> the defender declares defense but <em>before</em> dice are rolled.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's important to note that a feinted attack lands in a different sport than originally declared.  The attacker must also state the new location of an attack (usually within one or two areas of the original attack - more exotic feints may required greater execution cost).
          </p>
          <p>
            Feints have a tendency to lose their novel effect after a while when used against the same opponent.  Each repeated <em>identical</em> feint against a single opponent (over any number of duels) costs an extra CP to execute.
          </p>

        <h3><a href="#">Feint-and-Thrust</a></h3>
        <div> 
          <p>
            This is a more practical feint than Feint-and-Cut, as easily perform eith long swords and broadswords as with shorter weapons.  Like the feint-and-slash it beings with a false slash - usually overhnd or across (zones III, IV, and V), but finishes with a thurs to the head, neck, or torso.
          </p>
          <p>
            When attempting a feint-and-thrust, the attacker declares a <em>slashing</em> attack (rapiers are the exception, and may feint from a thrust), complete with location and CP dice expenditure.  The defender then declares his own defense - unlike the feint-and-slah, this maneuver is good against <em>parries only</em>.  The attacker now states that he is feinting and thrusting and adds any number of CP dice to his pool at a cost of one CD down thrown away for every one added.

        <h3><a href="#">Grapple</a></h3>
        <div> 
          <p>
            Offensive grappling comes in two forms - a set-up grapple, and a straight grapply.  Set-up grapples are easiest to do.  To "set up" your opponent you attack during one Exchange - this attack does no damager and needs only to tie or win.  On the following exchange, you may attack again to attempt a graplle with no activation cost (but don't forget range penalties).  Without the set-up the activation cost must be first be paid.  If this attack is successful you may either (a) toss your opponent or (b) pin him down.  For tosses you may either deal damage to him by putting down down <em>hard</em> (DR: ST+1B for most surfaces) or you can send him rolling or flying away.  Compare margin of successes: 0 = at your feet, or ST + (Margin - 2) feet away.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pinning your opponent down or wrapping them up reduces their total CP by 3/4 in the case of 4-5 successes in the Margin, 1-3 successes rende them "held" (1/2 CP).  A tie or failure leads to Wrestling, as per the Wrestling proficiency.

        <h3><a href="#">Half-Sword</a></h3>
        <div> 
          <p>
            This is one of the few practical ways to kill an armored opponent in full harness (full plate) with a sword.  Used with long swords, bastard sowrds, and other longer weapons, the half-sword technique is performed by grasping the blade of the sword with the off-hand in order to use the sword as a short spear or pole-weapon.  This technique is particularly useful in close-quarters as well, when swinging a long weapon may be impractical.  Half-swording reduces the sword's effective length by one or two steps, as desired.  Half-swording add +3 damage when thrusting against armor.  ATN when half-swording is always 5, DTN is always 6.
          </p>
          <p>
              Once can shift from normal grip to half-sword at any time, for instance even durng a Counter, though doing so during an exchange costs 1 CP and requires a Reflex/TN6 roll.  The half-sword may be released at any time.

        <h3><a href="#">Hook</a></h3>
        <div> 
          <p>
            Many pole-arms and aces are capable of hooking an opponent's limb or head.  This maneuver is executed like a thrust that intentionally misses, and then the shaft is pressed against the target and pulled.  This maneuver is particularly effective on the legs, cuasing one's opponent to fall and become prone.  After spending the Activation Cost (usually 1) allot dice for a refular thurst-like attack.  Eevery success in the Margin of Success lowers the target's Knockdown attribute by one die.  The hooked party then rolls Knockdown/TN8.  Failure drops him to the ground (-1/2 total CP for lying prone).  Fumbling causes damgage as a 6' fall).

        <h3><a href="#">Simultaneous Block/Strike</a></h3>
        <div> 
          <p>
            This gusty maneuver is not unlike the bind and Strike maneuver, except that is all happens in the course of one Exchange.  To perform this maneuver, divide your CP between attack and defense (remember that you may need dice for the next Exchange).  Either attack or defense must be half as large as the other (this you could divide 9 dice into 6 and 3, or 3 and 6, but not 2 and 7).  The defense is then rolled against your opponent's attack and your offence against his defense (if any).  This maneuver is obviously only useful in situations where both you <em>and</em> your opponent are attacking at once.  All attacks are resolved normally.

            This maneuver consists of leaping or stomping at an opponent and then halting suddenly to thors your opponent off guard.
          </p>
          <p>
            The maneuver's cost is variable.  Roll a contest of the attacker's WP against the defender's Reflex.  The attacker's TN is equal to his opponent's Per.  The defender's TN is equal to 7 plus the number of dice the attacker spend in executing the maneuver.  This count as an attack.  If the defender wins, then he may take the initiative normally.  If the attacker wins, then his opponent loses a number of CP wqual to the attacker's margin of success.  This maneuver if really only effective once.  Every additional attempt (whether the first one failed or not) cumulatively costs 1 extra CP to the attacker.

            Distraction has always been an important part of dueling and combat.  This maneuver allows you to toss a hat, glove, sidearm, or other object into your opponent's face, thereby distracting them.  To execute this maneuver, simply allot dice as for a normal attack.  The ATN is assumed to be 7 for most hand-held objects such as a fist of sand, glove, hat, or dagger.  Your opponent may dodge this object at DTN 7 (like a partial evasion).  If you win, each success in the Margin causes him to lose 1 CP on the following Exchange (not unlike a bind-and-strike).  Additionally, you retain the initiative.
