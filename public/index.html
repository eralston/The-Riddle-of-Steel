                <p>
                    The order for a combat round in TRoS is as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>1. Declare Stance</strong> - Aggressive (+2CP for offensive, -2CP defensive
                    maneuvers in first exchange), Defensive (+2CP on defensive, -2CP on offensive maneuvers
                    in first exchange), Neutral, or None (Reflex test, TN5, to react to incoming attacks)
                    <br />
                    <strong>2. Establish Aggressor and defender (Intiative)</strong> - Throw differently
                    colored dice to indicate attack or defense.
                    <br />
                    <strong>3. First "Exchange of Blows"</strong> - Attacker(s), from lowest Reflex
                    to highest, declares attack maneuver, location, and number of dice. Defender(s),
                    from lowest Reflex to highest, declares defense maneuver and number of dice.<br />
                    <strong>4. Resolve damage, if any, and determine new attitude</strong> - Success
                    or neutral result means attacker retains initiative. If one combatant successfully
                    fully evaded, go to step #1
                    <br />
                    <strong>5. Second "Exchange of Blows"</strong> - Just as Step 3<br />
                    <strong>6. Resolve damage, if any, and determine new attitude</strong> - If one
                    combatant successfully fully evaded, go to step #1; otherwise, refresh combat pools
                    and go to step #3.

                <a href="#">Weapon Length</a></h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Attacks against a longer weapon are made at a -1CP for each "step" in difference.
                    The penalty holds until the smaller weapon strikes a damaging blow, at which point
                    the penalty transfers to the longer weapon, for both attack and defense. Half-swording
                    is a popular technique to keep your weapon at an advantageous weapon length.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>1. Hand</strong> - Fists, daggers, knee-strikes, grappling, etc<br />
                    <strong>2. Short</strong> - Hatchets, short swords, long knives, etc<br />
                    <strong>3. Medium</strong> - Arming swords, flails, etc<br />
                    <strong>4. Long</strong> - Greatswords, bastard swords, spears, etc<br />
                    <strong>5. Very Long</strong> - Long spears, polearms<br />
                    <strong>6. Extremely Long</strong> - Pikes, lances

                <a href="#">Buying Initiative</a></h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    A risky maneuver, buying iniative allows a combatant to force their attack to strike
                    immediately, preempting an aggressor or taking initative when they initially rolled
                    defense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To buy initiative, spend a number of CP equal to your opponent's Perception (Per).
                    A contested roll is made between the buyer's WP and their opponent's Wit, both TNs
                    being equal to the other's Reflex. The buyer (and only the buyer) may raise his
                    opponent's TN by spending 1CP for every +1, to a maximum of the buyer's Wit. The
                    winner of the contest strikes first, the loser strikes second, assuming they have
                    any CP left.

            <h3>
                <a href="#">Damage</a></h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    When an attack succeeds, one calculates the Modified Damager Rating (DR) as (Weapon
                    Damage + Margin), then deduct the defender's Toughness (TO) attribute. If the rating
                    remains positive, then the attacker rolls a d6 to determine location based on the
                    damage type and intended location using the tables in Appendix One.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given the location, the Seneschal makes a reasonable determination if armor equipped
                    on the character defends that location. If applicable, the rating of that armor
                    further reduces the damage by its rating. Finally, the remaining damage is applied
                    as boxes to the victim, causing the effects noted. Damage to the same hit location
                    may, with Seneschal discretion, be cumulative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Shock</em> is a number of dice that is deducted from the victim's CP immediately.
                    If there is additional shock beyond the current CP, then apply it at the start of
                    next round as well. Shock is only applied once for each wound.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Pain</em> is a number of dice that is removed from the pool at the start of
                    the round when pools refresh. It is often reduced by the Willpower attribute, as
                    noted in the damage table.</p>
                <p>
                    <em>Blood Loss</em> covers the deterioration of health due to bleeding. At the start
                    of each round, the combatant must make an Endurance (EN) check against the cumulative
                    BL rating for all current wounds. Failure means temporarily losing a point of Health
                    (HT). When HT reaches 1, all attributes and pools are halved. When HT reaches zero,
                    the character immediately loses consciosness.</p>
                <p>
                    <em>Knockdown (ST + AG)/2</em> applies any time a blow reduces a combatants CP to
                    less than zero. Roll the knockdown trait versus TN equal to twice the number of
                    attacker's successes (three times if a mass weapon); or when indicated by the hit
                    location table. Failure indicates knockdown, which means combatant is prone and
                    CP is halved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Knockout (TO + 1/2WP)</em> covers when certain wounds or circumstances may incapacitate
                    combatants. Roll Knockout versus TN7, modified by circumstance. Failure results
                    in 1d10 rounds of unsconsciousness; fumbling results in 1d10x10 minutes.</p>

                <a href="#">Beat</a></h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The beat is an attack upon an opponent's weapon or shield in attempt to temporarily
                    remove it from the equation. Beats may only be performed at the start of a bout
                    or following a "pause". This sudden, brutal, and effective maneuver is executed
                    by declaring "Beat" as your offensive maneuver, along with the dice alloted to the
                    attack. The defender assigns defense dice to a defensive maneuver and the contest
                    is rolled normally. If the attacker wins the beat, then the defender's weapon (or
                    whatever is "beaten") is thrown aside and cannot be used in defense on the following
                    exchange. Additionally, every success in the attacker's Margin costs the defender
                    2 CP (this functions similar to Shock). If the defender wins then the round is resolved
                    normally.</p>
                <p>
                    Using a Beat is an excellent way to handle opponents with longer weapons as well:
                    all range penalties are but in half (round down) when beating.</p>

                <p>
                    This maneuver uses off-hand weapons (shields, poniards, etc) to bind or pin down
                    an opponent's weapon, opening up a clear follow-up attack. On one exchange, roll
                    attack as normal with the off-hand weapon or shield (using DTN as ATN for shields).
                    If this attack is successful, your opponent loses 1 CP for every success in the
                    margin, good on the next exchange.</p>

                    In principle, the attacker cuts with his weapons while simultaneously jumping backward
                    so as to evade an opponent's attack. This maneuver requires a great deal of skill,
                    but is indispensable to those who often find themselves in quick-draw style duels
                    where both opponents go straight to attacks.</p>
                <p>
                    To excecute this maneuver one attacks as normal, spending an additional die to activate
                    the maneuver. Once the maneuver is activated, any number of additional dice may
                    be spent to raise your opponent's ATN by one per additional die. On the downside,
                    your own ATN also raises, though only by one for every two dice spent this way.
                    It can only be activated as a slash-like manuever.

            <div>
                <p>
                    This is the first "trick" that most swordsmen know, consisting of slashing at one
                    region of the body, then changing direction mid-swing in an effort to pass the defender's
                    defenses entirely. This is relatively difficult and slow, with a high activation
                    cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Activation Cost is 1CP for every region the feint moves from the originally
                    declared location (min 1, max 4). Once the activation cost is paid, any number of
                    dice may be added to the attacker's hand, at a cost of 1 CP for every additional
                    die rolled in the attack. A feint in always declared <em>after</em> the defender
                    declares defense but <em>before</em> dice are rolled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feints have a tendency to lose their novel effect after a while when used against
                    the same opponent. Each repeated <em>identical</em> feint against a single opponent
                    (over any number of duels) costs an extra CP to execute.

                <p>
                    This is a more practical feint than Feint-and-Cut, as easily perform either longswords
                    and broadswords as with shorter weapons. Like the feint-and-slash, it beings with
                    a false slash - usually overhand or across (zones III, IV, and V), but finishes
                    with a thrust to the head, neck, or torso.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Activation Cost is 1CP for every region the feint moves from the originally
                    declared location (min 1, max 4). When attempting a feint-and-thrust, the attacker
                    declares a <em>slashing</em> attack (rapiers are the exception, and may feint from
                    a thrust), complete with location and CP dice expenditure. The defender then declares
                    his own defense - unlike the feint-and-slash, this maneuver is good against <em>parries
                        only</em>. The attacker now states that he is feinting and thrusting and adds
                    any number of CP dice to his pool at a cost of one CP thrown away for every one
                    added.

            <div>
                <p>
                    Offensive grappling comes in two forms - a set-up grapple, and a straight grapple.
                    Set-up grapples are easiest to do. To "set up" your opponent you attack during one
                    Exchange - this attack does no damage and needs only to tie or win. On the following
                    exchange, you may attack again to attempt a grapple with no activation cost (but
                    don't forget range penalties). Without the set-up the activation cost must be first
                    be paid. If this attack is successful you may either (a) toss your opponent or (b)
                    pin him down. For tosses you may either deal damage to him by putting down down
                    <em>hard</em> (DR: ST+1B for most surfaces) or you can send him rolling or flying
                    away. Compare margin of successes: 0 = at your feet, or ST + (Margin - 2) feet away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pinning your opponent down or wrapping them up reduces their total CP by 3/4 in
                    the case of 4-5 successes in the Margin, 1-3 successes rende them "held" (1/2 CP).
                    A tie or failure leads to Wrestling, as per the Wrestling proficiency.

                <a href="#">Half-Sword</a></h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    This is one of the few practical ways to kill an armored opponent in full harness
                    (full plate) with a sword. Used with longswords, bastard sowrds, and other longer
                    weapons, the half-sword technique is performed by grasping the blade of the sword
                    with the off-hand in order to use the sword as a short spear or pole-weapon. This
                    technique is particularly useful in close-quarters as well, when swinging a long
                    weapon may be impractical. Half-swording reduces the sword's effective length by
                    one or two steps, as desired. Half-swording add +3 damage when thrusting against
                    armor. ATN when half-swording is always 5, DTN is always 6.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once can shift from normal grip to half-sword at any time, for instance even during
                    a Counter, though doing so during an exchange costs 1 CP and requires a Reflex/TN6
                    roll. The half-sword may be released at any time.

                <p>
                    Many pole-arms and maces are capable of hooking an opponent's limb or head. This
                    maneuver is executed like a thrust that intentionally misses, and then the shaft
                    is pressed against the target and pulled. This maneuver is particularly effective
                    on the legs, causing one's opponent to fall and become prone. After spending the
                    Activation Cost (usually 1) allot dice for a refular thrust-like attack. Every success
                    in the Margin of Success lowers the target's Knockdown attribute by one die. The
                    hooked party then rolls Knockdown/TN8. Failure drops him to the ground (-1/2 total
                    CP for lying prone). Fumbling causes damgage as a 6' fall.

                    between attack and defense (remember that you may need dice for the next Exchange).
                    Either attack or defense must be half as large as the other (this you could divide
                    9 dice into 6 and 3, or 3 and 6, but not 2 and 7). The defense is then rolled against
                    your opponent's attack and your offence against his defense (if any). This maneuver
                    is obviously only useful in situations where both you <em>and</em> your opponent
                    are attacking at once. All attacks are resolved normally.

                    The maneuver's cost is variable. Roll a contest of the attacker's WP against the
                    defender's Reflex. The attacker's TN is equal to his opponent's Per. The defender's
                    TN is equal to 7 plus the number of dice the attacker spends in executing the maneuver.
                    This count as an attack. If the defender wins, then he may take the initiative normally.
                    If the attacker wins, then his opponent loses a number of CP equal to the attacker's
                    margin of success. This maneuver if really only effective once. Every additional
                    attempt (whether the first one failed or not) cumulatively costs 1 extra CP to the

                    sand, glove, hat, or dagger. Your opponent may dodge this object at DTN 7 (like
                    a partial evasion). If you win, each success in the Margin causes him to lose 1

                    Though primarily an offensive action, counters are intiatived by the defender. Sometimes

                    Additionally, due to the myriad nature of counters, the countering party should

            <div>
                <p>
                    This maneuver is not dissimilar to the offensive beat, but is initiatied from the
                    defender's side. This maneuver is only effective against thrusts and thrust-based
                    attacks, or against slash-based attacks made with 4 dice or less.</p>
                <p>
                    To execute an expulsion, simply declare "expulsion" alongside the standard parry.
                    Dice are allocated to the parry as usual, usually along with a two-die Activation
                    Cost. The effects are nearly identical to those of an offensive beat. If the parry
                    fails, then the round is resolved normally. If the parry is effective, then each
                    die in the defender's Margin causes a -1CP penalty against <em>thrusting</em> attacks
                    against the defender on the next exchange.

                <a href="#">Grapple</a></h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Defensive grappling appears in three forms - grappling to trap, grappling to pin,
                    and grappling to throw. The Activation Cost for each is the same.</p>
                <p>
                    <em>Grappling to Trap</em> is the most common form of grappling amongst swordsmen
                    and armed grapplers. If successful, every success in the Margin adds one die to
                    a follow-up attack as long as it is a punch, kick, or pommel strike. You can also
                    apply this bonus to initiatie wrestling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Grapplying to Throw</em> can be used to put your opponent down hard (ST+1b for
                    most surfaces, randomly distributed as falling damage) or you can send him rolling
                    away. Compare margin of successes: 0 = at your feet, or ST + (Margin - 2) feet away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Grappling to pin</em> to hold you opponent down or wrapping them up reduces
                    their total CP by 3/4 in the case of 4-5 successes in the Margin, 1-3 successes
                    render them "held" (1/2 CP). A tie or failure leads to Wrestling, as per the Wrestling
                    proficiency.
